      <h3>Purpose for Analysis</h3>
        <p class="data-info" style="font-size: 20px">
          In the United States, lung cancer is the second most common cancer in both men and women.
          According to the American Cancer Society, in 2021, it is estimated that over 235,000 new cases will be diagnosed, and 131,000 people will die from lung cancer.
          <br>
          <br>
          While early detection provides the best chance of survival, lung cancer often goes undetected causing a delayed diagnosis and poor prognosis for survival.
          Unfortunately, this will only be further exacerbated by the current pandemic, due to strained resources and reduced in-person visits to a physician that may
          otherwise have uncovered symptoms. If we can identify primary indicators of high mortality within the first year of surgery, we can prioritize symptoms and
          encourage early detection methods in certain populations at greater risk.
          <br>
          <br>
          The purpose of this project is to examine the relationship between pre-existing conditions in known lung cancer patients, and the survival rate one year after undergoing thoracic lung surgery.
          We aim to determine which conditions, if any, may be a determining factor in predicting patients' survival prognoses.
        </p>

      <h3>Problem to Be Solved</h3>
        <p class="data-info" style="font-size: 20px">
          Can we accurately predict a person's likelihood of surviving lung cancer one year post-operatively?
          <br>
          <br>
          Are there pre-existing conditions present before surgery that correlate to a greater likelihood of mortality?
        </p>
          <hr>
          <br>
      <h3>Machine Learning Models</h3>
        <p class="data-info" style="font-size: 20px">
          We created and analyzed multiple machine learning models to predict whether the pre-existing conditions could accurately predict 1 year post-surgery survival rate.
          By utilizing the Machine Learning algorithms and examining the feature importance of pre-existing conditions that are most likely to affect the patientsâ€™ outcome,
          we were able to predict the likelihood of post-surgery survival with an 83% accuracy and 86% precision using a normal neural network sequential learning model and subsequent grid search.
        </p>

      <h3>Data Set Information</h3>
        <p class="data-info" style="font-size: 20px">
          The data was collected retrospectively at Wroclaw Thoracic Surgery Centre for patients who underwent major lung resections for primary lung cancer in the years 2007-2011. The Centre is associated with the Department of Thoracic Surgery of the Medical University of Wroclaw and Lower-Silesian Centre for Pulmonary Diseases, Poland, while the research database constitutes a part of the National Lung Cancer Registry, administered by the Institute of Tuberculosis and Pulmonary Diseases in Warsaw, Poland (Lubicz, Pawelczyk, Rzechonek, Kolodziej).

                <p class="compare-analysis-large" style="font-size: 20px">This bar chart shows the comparison of the pre-existing conditions found in patients that survived post 1 year of the surgery versus
                  the patients who did not survive. One of the most important details for this side-by-side comparison is that there were 400 patients who survived versus 70 patients who did not.
                  This graph is more valuable when looking at the direct comparison. While smoking was found in 81% of the surviving patients, the non-surviving patients had 90% that were smokers. The
                  more valuable comparison is when the percentages are comparatively a third or more prevalently found in the non-surviving patients than there were in the surviving patients.

                  OC12, which was interesting. This would an interesting path to research for a deeper analysis to find out if this tumor size classification is the safer size and scale at which surgeons recommend this
                  surgery. Or what other factors contributed to have so many more patients with OC12 tumors to have this surgery rather than the other values.

                  by spirometry. This test can assist doctors gauge progression of lung disease and effectiveness of possible treatment. FCV refers to the amount of air a person can exhale, after inhaling as much as they can. FEV1
                  differs, but can be tested along with FVC, by measuring the amount of air a person can exhale in one second. This graph does show the correlation between the two measured tests by how the data points are grouped
                  together. When plotted against age, these measurements show the slightly decreasing linear path as age increases. This would correlate with the assumption that lung capacity decreases with age.

                  The main component that stood out here was that FEV levels are considerably higher in survivors. This leads us to believe that FEV levels are one of the main determining factors
                  in whether patients survive one year post surgery.</p>
