## Problems to be solved

- Can we accurately predict a person's likelihood of surviving lung cancer one year post-operatively?
- Are there pre-existing conditions present before surgery that correlate to a greater likelihood of mortality?
        
 ## Project Summary

We created and analyzed multiple machine learning models to predict whether the pre-existing conditions could accurately predict 1 year post-surgery survival rate.
By utilizing the Machine Learning algorithms and examining the feature importance of pre-existing conditions that are most likely to affect the patientsâ€™ outcome, we were able to predict the likelihood of post-surgery survival with an 83% accuracy and 86% precision using a normal neural network sequential learning model and subsequent grid search.


## Data Source:

We will be utilizing data collected at  Wroclaw Thoracic Surgery Centre in Poland for patients who underwent major lung resections for primary lung cancer between 2007-2011:
